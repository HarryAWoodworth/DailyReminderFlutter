    [ ] UI to add them to eventSource
    [ ] Stored for later
    [ ] Create repeating events
    [ ] Create events with a notification reminder
        [ ] Reminder
        [ ] Notification from app

[ ] Read Events
    [ ] Read from sharedPreferences
    [X] Map to days, display below
    [X] Tapping on the event crosses it out

[ ] Update Events
    [X] When Event is clicked, show update/delete icons
    [ ] Update takes it to filled out create UI

[X] Delete Events
    [X] Delete icon removes it from the map
    [X] Removes from UI as well (Calendar and list)

[ ] Update eventSource when app is closed
